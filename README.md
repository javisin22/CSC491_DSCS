**Title: Predicting Compiler Speedup via Fine-Tuned CodeRankEmbed + Autoencoder**

Check out the *Final Report* and *Slides* to get to know better about my work!!

The code itself can be found under the *FineTunedCodeRankEmbed.py* file.

In addition, I uploaded a couple papers that were useful to me in order to learn about the investigation project in order to have more context. These papers are:
- LearningToMakeCompilerOptimizationsMoreEffective.pdf
- LORE.pdf
